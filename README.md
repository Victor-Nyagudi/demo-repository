# Repository Demo

### Inclusive of markdown practice 

I manually created this README.md file to see how the process would go without doing it at the start of creating the repo. I'm also taking this opportunity to practice using markdown
I learned about from one of the tutorials on Github learning lab or something like that. I've already made an h1 and h3 above. So far, my learning has been going well :+1:.

I've learned things like: 

1. Creating a branch
2. Making a commit
3. Creating a pull request 
4. Merging branches 

I've also learned:

* Git and Github are actually two similar but different things
  * Git is the version control system, and Github is like the hub that hosts git, which I'm on right now
* You can use the terminal or some visual tools when working with Git (although learning how to use the terminal is **highly** recommended)

It's a slow process, but the **consistency** will pay off in _the end_.

#### Change to simulate a real life scenario

This is a change made as I followed along with the freeCodeCamp Git tutorial.

##### Another change to help me understand branching

Making this change initially while on the "feature-readme-instructions" branch as I learn about branching.
